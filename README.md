# Tiny Tweaks

A simple WordPress plugin to perform small tweaks to the wp-admin footer and the login page. Created as part of [Building Your First Plugin(s) â€“ the Why and How](https://malaysia.wordcamp.org/2024/session/building-your-first-plugins-the-why-and-how/) talk for WordCamp Malaysia 2024. 

This version has no settings. An improved version with a settings page can be found at [https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-settings-api](https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-settings-api). Another version that uses Codestar framework instead of the Settings API can be found at [https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-codestar](https://github.com/qriouslad/tiny-tweaks-codestar)
